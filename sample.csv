The stuff on his nightstand was knocked over as well.  He called his parents, they came over and made sure he was ok.  EMS was not called.  He stateshe has not missed any doses and was not necessarily sleep deprived.  He reports 5-6 hours of sleep (but that is not unusual) for him.  He was on the computer for ~3 hours that day but that is the only thing that was a bit different than his normal routine.  He can only come in this afternoon and you will not be here.

Dtr also thought that pt had a yeast infection last week, as pt was rubbing herself with the towel vigorously after shower, so pt was treated with a 1 day dose of monistat. Asked if pt has been taking her meds as prescribed dtr states that she just found out that pt has been spitting out her meds so now husband is watching more closely when she takes them.

I have ordered an EEG at xxxx-xxxx , I am not suspicious that any of your symptoms are occult seizure. I ordered because this is the second time you have requested one in the past 6 months.\par I believe your dizziness is secondary to M\'e9ni\'e8re's disease. However, it can be difficult to rule out the side effect from the medication. When we first switched you to the ER preparation it seemed to help. However, after your last 2 seizures we did increase her dosing your level is in the high normal range. That could contribute to a sense of imbalance, less frequently described as dizziness or vertigo. I will check a level again. If dizziness persists we may not be able to use Lamictal as monotherapy to treat your seizures. You can come in for your Lamictal level at your convenience. You can also wait until you have your EEG to have your Lamictal level drawn that same visit.\par Dr. xxxx-xxxxs\fs16\i\par\par (end of message body)\par\par\fs20\i0\par\par   \par\par ____________________________________________\par\b Message queued for Medfusion Member (ID 5036201) on Tuesday, January 06, 2015 at 3:43 PM\par\b0\par\par\plain\fs20\par\cf2\par}",MISCELLANEOUS,OTHERS,No,2015_1_50_1001

Because he is concerned about your seizure coverage and that he can't increase Lamictal anymore, he is adding another medication, Keppra, to what you take. He wants you to start 500mg 1 BID. This is a well tolerated medication. You can look it up, but all of these meds have similar side effects and things to watch out for.

They also faxed me today more questions to answer because her dose is over quantity allowed. Then spoke to John, pharmacist. She does not meet covered dx of Narcolepsy. Advised that she is being treated off label with Xyrem for fibromyalgia. John thought that would be a covered dx. Then we went through questions due to needing quantity override.

He called his cardiologist yesterday and they wanted to know if this was the maximum dose the patient could be or if he could up.  Could the medication possibly be causing this.  I explained that this medication is used to treat HTN.  The only new medication he has started is B12.  He does have morphine that he has for a herniated disc but that does not help his back pain.  He states when he does not have a headache he BP is usually in the 130s/80-90s.  He also said that WGF said he was going to check into the ""Fentanyl Pop.""  I call Gordon in the RNA pharmacy.  He spoke to Rick who stated that a compound pharmacy may be able to compound this drug but it is not on the market anymore.

It was hard for hiim to stand back up. He spent all day in bed and finally had to call 911 because he was in such pain. Went to WMC ER in Garner and had xray (negative) and was given IV dilaudid and valium and sent home with Valium prescription because they thought he had pulled a muscle or had muscle spasm in his lower back. He said he isn't going to fill the rx. for Valium because Dr. xxxx-xxxx did not prescribe it. He would rather have permission to take extra dilaudid PO for the pain and not add anything else to the mix. Is this ok and is there anything you want to suggest he take (steroids?) to help with his low back pain? He said he can barely get out of bed - does he need an MRI?
