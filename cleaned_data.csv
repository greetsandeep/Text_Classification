They were out of network with the patient, so they forwarded it to Apria Healthcare. I spoke w/ Kerri at Apria Healthcare, she said that they had tried over 10 times between April and July to contact the patient with no result. In Sept they cancelled the work order for DME Equipment. I asked them if the patient would have to redo a sleep study, she stated no. That all we would need to send is an updated Rx for the equipment. She said that she will file it with insurance and if they require a more recent office note, then we will have to schedule him a quick follow up with Susannah. I forwarded this information to Susannah, so she can build a new Rx for CPAP Equipment to be sent to Apria. Follow-up by: Nicole Stone, May 20, 2015 1:38 Additional Follow-up",6,16,0,2015568631001

I have ordered an EEG at xxxx-xxxx , I am not suspicious that any of your symptoms are occult seizure. I ordered because this is the second time you have requested one in the past 6 I believe your dizziness is secondary to disease. However, it can be difficult to rule out the side effect from the medication. When we first switched you to the ER preparation it seemed to help. However, after your last 2 seizures we did increase her dosing your level is in the high normal range. That could contribute to a sense of imbalance, less frequently described as dizziness or vertigo. I will check a level again. If dizziness persists we may not be able to use Lamictal as monotherapy to treat your seizures. You can come in for your Lamictal level at your convenience. You can also wait until you have your EEG to have your Lamictal level drawn that same Dr. (end of message Message queued for Medfusion Member (ID 5036201) on Tuesday, January 06, 2015 at 3:43",5,10,0,20151501001
